# Twitterer

This project will help familiarize LA Blueprint's devs with React Native. It will also help devs set up their environment before jumping into the NPO projects.

## What is this project?

You will develop a super simple Yik Yak/Twitter clone.

In this app, a user can
- enter their name
- see a list of everyone's tweets in chronological order
- create a new tweet

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MldynDarDzo

Important tools you will use:
- React Native: A library and framework for building Android and iOS apps in Javascript.
- Firebase: A cloud provider that contains many useful services. Here, we will use Firestore, a database.
- ESLint: A linter, or a tool that checks your code for style issues. This helps keep all our code consistent.
- Visual Studio Code: You can use any editor you want, but VS Code is what most of us at LA Blueprint use and contains many features that will improve your workflow.
- Git: Practice version control by commiting small diffs and commiting often.
